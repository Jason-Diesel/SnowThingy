# Snow
<strong>Important! This code is not meant to be readeble but I put it up for free just beacuse</strong><br>
The program will cause memory leaks beacuse I am to lazy to do anything about it (I also made it in two days).<br>

<strong>The program will only work in certain circumstances (size and position of plane and billboardgroup)</strong>

<br>

Also when a new build is created the Assimp DLL file is needed to be added in the x64->Debug/Release folder (I don't know if x86 works).

<strong>controlls</strong>
<ul>
  <li>WASD + space + CTRL - move</li>
  <li>Tab - to change from mouse mode to camera mode</li>
  <li>ESC - exit</li>
</ul> 

<br>
<strong>The Important files that tackels the problem is: </strong>
<ul>
  <li>TestScene</li>
  <li>Billboard</li>
  <li>Snow</li>
  <li>BillboardVertex.vert</li>
  <li>BillboardGeometry.geom</li>
  <li>Billboardfragment.frag</li>
  <li>SnowCompute.comp</li>
  <li>All tesselation shaders</li>
</ul>
